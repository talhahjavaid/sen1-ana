Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
Training a machine learning model for sentiment analysis.
Visualization of the results and insights from the data.
Dataset
The dataset used consists of tweets extracted from Twitter API or publicly available datasets. Each tweet is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.
